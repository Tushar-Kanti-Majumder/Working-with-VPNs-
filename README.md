# Working-with-VPNs-
I followed all the necessary steps to successfully set up and test ProtonVPN on my Windows device. After signing up for the free tier of ProtonVPN using a temporary email, I downloaded and installed the VPN client. Once logged in, I connected to a server and verified my IP address had changed using WhatIsMyIP. I then confirmed that my traffic was encrypted by browsing a website while connected to the VPN and ran a check on ipleak.net to ensure there were no leaks in my connection. I also compared the browsing speed and IP address before and after disconnecting from the VPN to understand its impact on performance.

Furthermore, I researched ProtonVPN’s encryption and privacy features, including its AES-256 encryption, no-logs policy, and Secure Core technology. In the report, I’ve outlined the benefits of using a VPN, such as enhanced privacy, security on public Wi-Fi, and the ability to bypass geo-restrictions. I also covered the limitations of VPNs, like reduced speeds, limited free server options, and the potential for IP leaks. Attached to this report, you’ll find a screenshot showing the IP address change and a text file detailing the VPN setup steps, along with my observations.
